# PDF Service Module Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the PDF service module (`pdf-api.ts`), which defines API service functions for uploading and querying PDF files. The module is written in TypeScript and integrates with the previously provided `Chat` React component and banner configurations (`banner-section-desktop.json`, `banner-section-mobile.json`, and `banner-script.js`) to support PDF-related interactions in a chat-based interface.

## Overview
The `pdf-api.ts` module provides three asynchronous functions to interact with a backend API for uploading and querying PDF files. It uses Axios for HTTP requests and assumes a backend server is running at `http://localhost:3000/pdf`. The module is designed to work with the `Chat` component to process user queries and can be extended to dynamically update banner content based on PDF query results.

## Service Functions

### uploadPDF
Uploads a PDF file to the backend server for processing.

- **Signature**:
  ```typescript
  export const uploadPDF = async (pdfFile: File): Promise<AxiosResponse<UploadPDFResponse>> => {
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('pdf', pdfFile);
      return axios.post<UploadPDFResponse>(`${BASE_URL}/upload`, formData, {
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
      });
  };
