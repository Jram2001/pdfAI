## Overview
The PDF service module (`pdf-api.ts`) provides three asynchronous functions for interacting with a backend API to handle PDF file uploads and queries. It uses the Axios library for HTTP requests and is designed to work with a backend server running at a specified `BASE_URL`. The module is integrated with the `Chat` component to process user queries and can be extended to interact with the banner configurations for dynamic content updates.

## Service Functions

### uploadPDF
Uploads a PDF file to the backend server.

- **Signature**:
  ```typescript
  export const uploadPDF = async (pdfFile: File): Promise<AxiosResponse<UploadPDFResponse>> => {
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append('pdf', pdfFile);
      return axios.post<UploadPDFResponse>(`${BASE_URL}/upload`, formData, {
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
      });
  };
